# New compiler pipeline

The new compiler pipeline refactors the original compiler to provide cleaner
implementation.

## Use of the new compiler

`rabbit` command takes the following options for the new compiler:

- `--new`: It replaces the compilation with the new compiler pipeline;
  the new compiler generates the final output spthy file specified 
  by `-o xxx.spthy` option.
- `--test-new`: Use the new compiler pipeline along with the original.
  The original compiler generates the final output spthy file specified 
  by `-o xxx.spthy` option.  In addition, `xxx.spthy.2` file is generated
  by the new compiler. It also compares the success and failure of
  the `Loader` (the original source checker) and `Typer` (the new one).

## Transition graph SVG

The `--svg` option renders transition graphs using Graphviz.

When `--svg` option is given with `-o xxx.spthy` option, the transition graph
is rendered to a SVG file `xxx.spthy.svg`. With `--test-new` option, another
graph `xxx.spthy.2.svg` is generated for the new compilation `xxx.spthy.2`.

## New compiler pippeline stages

The new compiler pipeline consists of the following stages:

- `Typer`: Name-checking
- `Sem`: Compilation to a transition graph
- `Spthy`: The final output to Tamarin's spthy code.

Here is a diagram of the original and new compilation pipelines:

graph TD
  rab(.rab file)  -- Parser --> Input
  Input -- Loader --> Context(Context /w Syntax)
  Context -- Totamarin --> Tamarin(Tamarin /w Postprocessing)
  Tamarin -- Tamarin.print_tamarin --> spthy(.spthy file)
  Input -- Typer --> Typed
  Typed -- Sem.compile --> Sem(Sem /w Sem.optimize)
  Sem -- Spthy.compile_sem --> Spthy
  Spthy -- Spthy.print --> spthy2(.spthy file)
```


### Typer, name checker

Note that this is not really typing but just checking name occurrences to
reject the unbound use of names. It however uses the similar technique of 
static typing, thus called `Typer` and its output AST is called `Typed`.

Module `Typed` defines yet another version of Rabbit AST than `Input`
and `Syntax`. It provides a cleaner implementation:

- Variable name is no longer `Name.t`, a simple string, but `Ident.t`, a string
  paired with a integer stamp, to avoid name reuse confusions.
- Variants without a parameter and with a parameter are unified.
- Variant arguments are labeled for better identification.
- The name-checking environment `Env.t` is attached to each AST node.

`Typer.load` takes a filename of Rabbit code. The code is first parsed 
by `Parser` to a list of `Input.decl`.  The input declarations are then
name-checked by `Typer` and rejected if there is any unbound uses of names.
If there finds no errornous uses of names, `Typer.load` returns a list of
`Typed.decl`, Rabbit declarations annotated with name-checking environments.

### Subst, process instantiation

Module `Subst` instantiates process definitions `Typed.Process` to `Subst.proc`
and `Subst.proc_group_desc` for each process group in a system declaration:
`p(ch1,..,chn)` and `!n.(p<e>(ch1,..,chn) | .. | p<e>(ch1,..,chn))`.
In the instantiated processes, variable are properly are renamed with fresh 
integer stamps to avoid name crashes.

### Sem, the semantics as a transition graph

Module `Sem` defines `Sem.t`, the semantics of a Rabbit system as a transition
graph. It also provides an optimization: compression of transition graph edges.

`Sem.compile` takes a list of `Typed.decl` and compile it to `Sem.t`:

- The processes declared in a system are first instantiated 
  by `Subst.instantiate_proc_group`.
- Each instantiated process is compiled to a transition graph 
  of `Sem.edge list`.
- The processes `Pi` in a process group `!n.(P1|..|Pn)` are compiled together.
- The channel access allowances by system calls (by system call names) 
  and in process code (by name `.` in `allow` declarations) are compiled 
  for each instantiated process as `access_controls`.
- The other members of a system: `signature`, `constants` and `lemmas` are
  also gathered and compiled.

The type of facts `Typed.fact` is extended to `Sem.fact` with new facts
`Fresh`, `Structure`, `Loop` and `Access` introduced by the semantic compilation.

If `--svg` option is given, transition graphs of a compiled system are rendered
using Graphviz to an SVG file.

### Spthy, the final output to Tamarin

Module `Spthy` compiles the semantics `Sem.t` to `Spthy.t` by converting 
transition graph edges to Tamarin rules `Spthy.rule`.

The fact type is extended again in `Spthy` with constructors `Const`,
`Initing_const`, `Initing_proc_group`, `Inited_proc_group`, `State`
and `Transition`.

Once compiled to `Spthy.t`, it is printed by `Spthy.print` to the final
Tamarin spthy code. How the `Spthy` facts are converted to Tamarin facts
is defined by `Spthy.string_of_fact`.
