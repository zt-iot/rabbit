    x
  
  rule `NEquality_gen' has unbound variables: 
    x, y

Inexistant lemma actions
========================

  lemma `AlwaysStarts__' references action 
    fact "Loop__Back" (arity 2, Linear) 
  but no rule has such an action.
  
  lemma `AlwaysStarts__' references action 
    fact "Loop__Start" (arity 2, Linear) 
  but no rule has such an action.
  
  lemma `AlwaysStartsWhenEnds__' references action 
    fact "Loop__Finish" (arity 2, Linear) 
  but no rule has such an action.
  
  lemma `AlwaysStartsWhenEnds__' references action

Derivation Checks
=================

  Derivation checks timed out.
  Use --derivcheck-timeout=INT to configure timeout.
  Set to 0 to deactivate for no timeout.
